USAGE:
    python3 file_templater.py [OPTIONS...] -f <FILE> -o <FILE>
    
OVERVIEW:
    A simple Python script designed to generate and format a pair of C++ files that serve as
    scaffolds or templates to save time and and better facilitate efficiency and ease of development. 
    
DESCRIPTION:
	This script is designed to generate a pair of pre-formatted files which act as a scaffold or template for further development.
    This pair of files is given by: (1) a header file (.h), (2) a source/implementation file (.cpp) specifically for the C++ programming 
    language.

I have updated the code inside your Canvas editor to better reflect the structure I am looking for.  Now, I would like to begin discussing how we can implement our script in order to generate a header file that is IDENTICAL to the template that I provided you earlier in our discussion.

For now, I would like you to remove the argument of "Which special members to generate (Rule-of-5 or 7)."  from our scripts.  Rather, I need you to adhere to the example file that I provided to you earlier and this file needs to specifically implement only headers of this general outline for now.  Furthermore, I need you to remove the arguments of "author" and "date".  Rather, I want these to be automatically determined by the script in the format of "May 1, 2025" (where this data is calculated in Python of course) and "Collin A. Bond" (which is a fixed internal constant).
    







    For now, I would like you to rmake a few edits to the Canvas file and then I would like to begin implementing more of the core features that we will need for our script.

First, remove the argument of "Which special members to generate (Rule-of-5 or 7)."  from our scripts.  Rather, I need you to adhere to the example file that I provided to you earlier and this file needs to specifically implement only headers of this general outline for now.  Furthermore, I need you to remove the arguments of "author" and "date".  Rather, I want these to be automatically determined by the script in the format of "May 1, 2025" (where this data is calculated in Python of course) and "Collin A. Bond" (which is a fixed internal constant).

Please note, once more, that I am now asking you to make these changes to the CANVAS file that we have open right here in our conversation together.









Here is the current state of the templated / example file that I want to produce here.  Please look at the contents of this file quite thoroughly.  I need you to note, however, that this is still a work-in-progress and I had not finished creating it to the exact criteria that I need.

As you should be able to see, there are a number of strings that I have embedded in the code that are designed to act as placeholder values which will be replaced by a search and replace or regular expression pattern with a value that will be generated when we run the Python script to generate a specific file. 






This is likely to NOT conclude all of the information that I need the generator to produced from our code.  However, it will require some additional discussion to determine what else we will need in here.

I would now like to proceed with creating the general layout and design of the Python script that we will ultimately use to generate these files.  I have a general Python file that I have begin developing for the basic structure of this script, please use this file to begin the basis of your work.  Create a "canvas" session inside of our conversation to host the code that we will develop on this script for the remainder of our conversation.  

Please begin populating this script in a general manner---meaning, I need you to focus first on sketching out the primary functions that we will need to accomplish the sub-tasks that will inevitably arise in our solution for the overall problem.  Do not flush out the body of these functions to a great extent just yet.  Rather, just define them as empty and/or leave a comment inside the function that describes what its purpose will be. Later into our conversation, we will create code for their implementations together.  

As a first note for our development, I would like to ask that you assign explicit strings for certain banners and comment styles that I use in my code skeleton.  In this way, we can guarantee that the banner style remains consistent to my existing code and it will be easy to modify it if I ever need to in the future.  Please begin by creating a "Canvas" session in our conversation to host the code for the Python script we will create together.
